🌺 Hibiscus
AI-Powered Universal Study Workspace

Hibiscus is a full-stack AI learning platform that transforms passive studying into active understanding.

Upload PDFs, paste text, or submit web URLs. Highlight content directly inside the platform and instantly generate AI-powered summaries, flashcards, and exam-ready notes — all in one organized workspace.

🚀 Problem

Students study from multiple sources — PDFs, websites, notes, and articles.

Their highlights are scattered. Revision becomes inefficient. Understanding remains shallow.

Most tools summarize content.
Few tools evaluate how well you actually understand it.

Hibiscus is not just a summarizer.
It is a cognitive learning assistant.

It combines:

Smart highlighting

AI-generated study material

Confusion detection

Active recall evaluation

Critical thinking challenges

Focus monitoring

All inside one unified dashboard.
